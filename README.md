# React Native Dashboard Project

This is a React Native-based dashboard for managing constituent issues. It expands the platform by integrating a web-based dashboard with the same backend as the mobile app, providing a unified system where issues can be reported via the app and managed through the dashboard.

## Overview

The dashboard allows leaders to:
- Manage constituent issues efficiently.
- Access the same backend system as the mobile app.
- Maintain a seamless workflow for reporting and resolving issues.

### Loom Demo

To see a walkthrough of the dashboard and how it functions, check out this [Loom Demo Video](https://www.loom.com/share/59f09706447a4201ac0109ca5af65875?sid=f6c0a0a7-9765-4b26-88de-3d6d3bf2f34b).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can check this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If they are not installed, you can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

```bash
cd your-project-directory
```

3. **Install the dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Dashboard

1. **Start the development server**:

```bash
npm start
```

2. **Access the web version**:
   After the development server has started, type `w` in the terminal to launch the web version. This will open the dashboard in your default web browser.

3. **Open the Dashboard**:
   You can access the dashboard by navigating to `http://localhost:19006` in your web browser.

### Key Features

- **Unified System**: The dashboard is integrated with the same backend as the mobile app, ensuring all data is in sync.
- **Issue Management**: Leaders can view, manage, and update constituent issues in real time.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure your backend server is running so that the dashboard can communicate with the API.
- You may also need to configure environment variables depending on your backend setup.
